Account setup and tool installation
-----------------------------------

To start with, make sure you have a GitHub account: https://www.github.com

Also ensure that Git is installed locally on your machine:

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Next setup an SSH keys:

Generate a new SSH key pair on your local machine if you don't have one
> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

Copy the public key file (e.g. id_ed25519.pub) to your clipboard
> clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub    # On Windows
> pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  # On macOS
> cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub       # On Linux, then manually copy

Login to your GitHub account and goto:
A. Settings -> Access -> SSH & GPG keys -> New SSH key
B. Enter a title for the key, then paste the public key we generated in step 2.

We will use a number of tools during the workshop, so you can install these in advance.
