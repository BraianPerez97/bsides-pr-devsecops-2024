Workshop Setup
--------------

This is a quick setup guide for the BSides PR workshop "Introduction to DevSecOps" on April 13th 2024.

You can use this document to get your development environment configured prior to the event.

The source code and guides for the workshop will be available on the 11th at:

Account setup and tool installation
-----------------------------------

To start with, make sure you have a GitHub account: https://www.github.com

Also, ensure that Git is installed locally on your machine:

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
> On Windows accept the default setting, but change the default editor to use VS Code, unless you're comfortable with the default

Next, set an SSH key (On Windows, we recommend using git-bash):

Generate a new SSH key pair on your local machine if you don't have one
> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"  # Create your key
> eval $(ssh-agent -s)                               # Ensure ssh-agent is running
> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa                              # Add your private SSH key to the authentication agent

Copy the public key file (e.g., id_ed25519.pub) to your clipboard
> clip   ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub    # On Windows
> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub           # On Windows if using git-bash
> pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  # On macOS
> cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub       # On Linux, then manually copy

Login to your GitHub account and go to:
A. Settings -> Access -> SSH & GPG keys -> New SSH key
B. Enter a title for the key, then paste the public key we generated in step 2.

We will use several tools during the workshop so that you can install these in advance.

Recommended IDE: VS Code https://code.visualstudio.com/

Docker: https://www.docker.com/get-started/
> Note that Docker is required for Horusec's VS Code plugin

Horusec plugin for VS Code: https://docs.horusec.io/docs/extensions/visual-studio-code/

You may also like to read about .gitignore files in advance:

If you have any questions our team will be walking around the classroom to help you with installation questions and get you unblocked.
